*we are talking to a school manager on ways to decrease bullying among children
*we assume that the manager will organize a lecture for parents to teach them some parenting tips.

=the average student have ($$) friends, while the bullied and lonely student have ($$) friends on average.

=having less friends leads to feeling lonely, which in turn lets them use the internet a lot more which makes them prone to cyberbullying, also using the internet for long periods is bad for their mental health.

=also being bullied can lead to absence from important days like their exams due to the feel of awkwardness (need the average number of absent days that bullied students do).

=tell the people that bullying does not differ according to gender.

=student having less friends are more prune to bullying, so it is better to encourage students to make friends and parents should help them do so.


=it is best to teach children to respect each other regardless of their body morph, race, etc.

but it is still better to not let the children be obese/underweight, this advice is for parents to always watch children's eating habits and engage them in sports.

=being bullied inside school, promotes being bullied outside school, this is due to the personality changes that the bullied kid undergoes, which lowers his self esteem and thus increases his probability of getting bullied elsewhere.


=tell a story of a kid who has less number of close friends, his parents dont understand his problem, is overweight, this kid gets bullied, thus missing school, and is planning to miss his exams.
(do not be like this boy)

=on the other hand, another kid has 4 close friends and does not feel lonely, his parents understand his problems and his speech, is a sporty kid having an acceptable body morph, this kid is liked by his colleages and gets good grades and does not report being bullied anywhere even on the internet.
(try to be like this boy)
